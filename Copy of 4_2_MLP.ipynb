In our model definition we've used a softmax activation function on the output layer to turn the outputs into probability-like values, but have only set this to be enabled when we are not training the model. We've done this because we will use PyTorch's implementation of Cross Entropy Loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) during training which implicitly adds a softmax before a logarithmic loss (technically it adds a log-softmax activation followed by a negative log-likelihood loss as this has much better numerical properties). If you've used a library like Keras before you should note that this approach is different to the one taken there - Keras expects you to explicitly add a `Softmax` layer to use with its `categorical_crossentropy` loss.\n","\n","In our case the softmax isn't actually necessary for model evaluation if we're only interested in the most likely class; the _logits_ (unscaled log probabilities) provided by the final fully connected layer before the softmax can be used directly as the largest logit will correspond to the most likely class.\n","\n","## Training and Evaluating the Model\n","We can now fit and evaluate the model.

In the code below we'll fit the model to the data over 10 epochs using batches of 128 images provided by the `DataLoader` defined previously.
