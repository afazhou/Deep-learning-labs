Markov chains\n","\n","We'll start our exploration of modelling sequences and building generative models using a 1st order Markov chain. The Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. In our case we're going to learn a model over a set of characters from an English language text.
